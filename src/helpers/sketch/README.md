# Sketch Helper 

Turn a designer's `.sketch` files into JavaScript modules.

The Sketch Helper class is an abstract representation of a `.sketch` file produced by Sketch App.  When Skypager's runtime is extended with this helper,
you are able to use it as if it was a module you required.

This helper works in node, and in the browser (provided you use a webpack loader, or the helper itself to generate the sketchtool JSON metadata)

Given a path to a `.sketch` file, the Sketch Helper can load any level of detail about the document's internal object model, provided you can obtain it via the `sketchtool` CLI

It should also be able to export `.png` and `.svg` assets.

With this metadata, it is possible to use `.sketch` files to build an object graph that is organized the way a Designer / Sketch User  
organizes their design.  If the Designer uses naming conventions for their pages, artboards, and layers , this object graph can be easily navigated, making it possible to do all sorts of crazy things!

## Example

The following script can run in node, you need `sketchtool` in your path.

```javascript
// using the node runtime, we can read the sketchfiles and use sketchtool directly.
const runtime = require('@skypager/node')
// tell the runtime to use the sketch helper so that we can create modules to represent them
runtime.use(require('@skypager/helpers-sketch'))
// create an instance of the sketch helper by giving us a name for it, and telling us the path
const sketch = runtime.sketch('my-sketch-doc', { path: '/path/to/file.sketch' }) 

async function main() {
  // returns an array of layer objects
  await sketch.listAllLayers().then(layers => console.log({ layers }))
  
  // returns an array of artboard objects
  await sketch.listAllArtboards().then(artboards => console.log({ artboards }))
  
  // if your names follow a naming convention, you can use a route pattern to extract them as attributes 
  await sketch.listAllArtboards({
    namePattern: ':category/:subcategory/:artboardName'
  }) // => [{ category: 'mobile', subcategory: 'darkTheme', artboardName: 'HomeScreen', ...restOfSketchToolArtboardAttributes }]
  
  await sketch.listAllLayers({
    namePattern: ':region/:layerName'
  }) // => [{ pageName: 'HomeScreen', region: 'TopNav', layerName: 'CurrentUser', ...restOfSketchToolArtboardAttributes }]
  
  // get literally everything there is about the document
  await sketch.dump()
}
```

### Webpack Loader

[@skypager/helpers-sketch/sketchtool-loader](./sketchtool-loader.js) can be used to process `.sketch` files and turn them
into JSON structures that can be used to hydrate the Sketch helper instances in the browser, with the same metadata we rely on `sketchtool` to provide us with 
directly in the node runtime. 

This will enable you to build, for example, a React App whose state is powered by a Sketch Helper instance.

## Subclassing Example

The Sketch Helper class by itself is pretty low-level.  It provides an easier way of navigating the `sketchtool` JSON dumps.

The real value of this helper will come through subclassing it in a way which matches the mental model of the designer who created the `.sketch` file.

For example, say you had a `.sketch` template which consisted of an artboard that had a color palette, and typography display.  

If the designer names and organizes the layers in a way you both agree on, you can create a `Theme` subclass which might generate CSS or less files in your project.

```javascript
import Sketch from '@skypager/helpers-sketch'

export default class ThemeSketch extends Sketch {
  // assuming layer names:
  //  - typography/mainHeading
  //  - typography/subHeading
  //  - typography/copy
  generateTypographyRules() {
    const { filter } = this.lodash
    const typeLayers = filter(this.layers, { category: 'typography' })
    // need to write this function to find the values in the sketch metadata
    return typeLayers.map(findFontNameSizeAndWeight)
  }  

  // assuming layer names:
  //  - color/primary
  //  - color/secondary
  generateColorRules() {
    const { filter } = this.lodash
    const colorLayers = filter(this.layers, { category: 'color' })
    // need to write this function to find the values in the sketch metadata
    return colorLayers.map(findColorNameAndValues)   
  }
}

// now your runtime can load an entire collection of themes 
export function attach(runtime) {
  const { Helper } = runtime
  Helper.registerHelper('theme', () => ThemeSketch)

  Helper.attach(runtime, ThemeSketch, {
    registryProp: 'themes',
    lookupProp: 'theme'
  }) 
}
```

Now let's say you have a few theme sketch files in a folder

```javascript
import runtime from '@skypager/node'
import * as ThemeSketch from './ThemeSketch'

runtime.use(ThemeSketch)

const darkTheme = runtime.theme('DarkTheme', {
  path: '/path/to/dark.theme.sketch' 
})

const lightTheme = runtime.theme('LightTheme', {
  path: '/path/to/light.theme.sketch' 
})

darktheme.generateColorRules().then(writeThemToLessFilesOrSomething)
lightTheme.generateColorRules().then(writeThemToLessFilesOrSomething)
```

## Future Plans

- Sketch Helper instances are observable (i.e. they have a `state` property that is a mobx observable) which means we can keep their state in sync with Sketch App through their plugin interface, or whenever the file is saved (easiest in electron.)
