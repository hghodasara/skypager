# CHANGELOG

## Releases

### 1.4.0

- [@skypager/runtime] low level api improvements
    - you can now await runtime.nextStateChange() or runtime.nextStateChange("someProperty")
    - Helper classes can define static initialState functions
    - Helper initialization lifecycle and statefulness happens in a better order

- [@skypager/runtime] helper state improvements, convenience methods 
    - helper instances get setState, replaceState, which has the same semantics as runtime's, (and React)
    - `await runtime.nextEvent(event)` will return a promise which resolves when the next event fires
    - `await runtime.nextStateChange(attributeName?)` will return a promise which resolves when the next state change occurs. pass an optional attribute name to listen for only changes to one key 
    - `await runtime.untilStateMatches(validatorObjectOrFunction)` will return a promise which resolves when the validator matches current state 
    - all of the above also work on helper instances

- [@skypager/features-file-manager]
    - (enhancement) added exportGraph() method to packageManager and moduleManager.  This represents the packages as nodes and edges,
    where the edges represent the dependencies between packages (dev dependencies, optional, etc).  This is really useful for visualizing
    the relationships between all of the packages.  Once I'm able to get the dependency between file modules mapped out, i'll do the same for those.

- [@skypager/runtime]
    - (bugfix) the node version of @skypager/runtime did not use the babel polyfill

- [@skypager/cli]
    - (enhancement) the `skypager` CLI will attempt to search all @skypager packages which have a scripts folder, as well as any other 
    workspace paths (for @scoped projects) which have a scripts folder, when trying to run a command that isn't provided by @skypager/devtools, @skypager/cli, or @skypager/webpack

### 0.1.11

- [@skypager/helpers-server](src/helpers/server)
    - (enhancement) - Added endpoints registry in the server helper.  The endpoints registry allows us to register express route adding functions / middleware, and then load them by name when creating a server.
- [@skypager/webpack](src/devtools/webpack) 
    - (enhancement) - Extracted mdx parser function from the webpack loader, so that it can be used in a standalone way by other libraries
- [@skypager/runtime] 
    - (bugfix) - Fixed bug in vm feature's createScript method
